#Deep Q Learning for ATARI using Tensorflow

Usage : 'python main.py (ckpt file)'

This version is still under test.

If 'Memory Error' arises, change the value of 'db_size' in main.py

if anyone does experiment with db size = 1000000, Please let me know the results.


Requirements

1. Tensorflow
2. opencv2
3. Arcade Learning Environment ( https://github.com/mgbellemare/Arcade-Learning-Environment )
